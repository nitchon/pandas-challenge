Module 4 Challenge


Using Pandas, I analyzed school and standardized test data to create the following summaries:

## District Summary
    The District Summary includes the following metrics:
    - Total schools
    - Total students
    - Total budget
    - Average math score
    - Average reading score
    - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary
    The School Summary includes the following metrics:
    - School name
    - School type
    - Total students
    - Total school budget
    - Per student budget
    - Average math score
    - Average reading score
    - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    Using the school summary and Pandas sort function, below is a screenshot of the top five performing schools
